React Native Redux Example
======================================================

## Description
This is a example repo for showing how to use Redux with React Native. Everything that is important to understanding the redux setup / flow can be found in the `app` directory. This example makes a simple API call to the Dark Sky Api to display today's weather. [Here](https://medium.com/@stowball/a-dummys-guide-to-redux-and-thunk-in-react-d8904a7005d3#.bultwm53oa) is an article explaining the non redux way of doing something and comparing it to a redux version that is similar to the setup in this repo. Also check out the [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) docs. Enjoy and feel free to contact me with any questions :).

## Pre Installation
Please follow `Installing Dependencies` section found [here](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html)
Also follow the rest of the setup for both ios and android in order to have your environment ready to run the native app on a device or xcode / android avd
